<h1> OCP4 HashiCorp Vault Demo </h1>

    <h2>HashiCorp Vault secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets in modern computing. </h2>
    <p>
  <p>
    Running Vault with OpenShift can be done differently based on the environments and needs, whether you are running Vault side-by-side or within OpenShift. The goal is to provide a variety of options around how to leverage Vault with OpenShift.
Instead of sharing credentials and tokens across pods and services, Vault allows each service to uniquely authenticate and request their own unique credentials. Vault set out to provide a variety of options around how to leverage Vault and OpenShift to securely introduce secrets into applications and infrastructure.
  <p>The focus of this workshop is to enable individual services to authenticate and request their own set of distinct credentials through the use of Vault, rather than having to share credentials and tokens among different pods and services. OpenShift will be utilized to safely incorporate secrets into both applications and infrastructure.</p>
